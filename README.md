## Introduction

This repository showcases the Neovim configuration I currently use for my day-to-day workâ€”and, quite honestly, serves as a backup in case I need to start from scratch.

*Setting up Neovim is like trying to build a spaceship out of Lego pieces while blindfolded: the endless sea of plugins is equal parts thrilling and overwhelming. Arriving at a configuration that doesn't make you want to toss your keyboard out the window? That's a journey of trial, error, and a pinch of masochism.*

**Fair warning**: I'm still fairly new to Neovim (less than six months in), so this configuration is basicâ€”covering just the essentials I need for now. As I get more comfortable and explore Neovim's vast capabilities, this setup will likely evolve, growing alongside my understanding and workflow.

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.8.0 (0.9+ recommended)
- Git
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for proper icon display
- Node.js and npm (for certain LSP servers)
- Ripgrep (for Telescope live grep functionality)
- A terminal with true color support

## Installation

1. **Backup your existing Neovim configuration** (if you have one):

```bash
# Backup existing configuration
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# Also backup Neovim data directory if it exists
[ -d ~/.local/share/nvim ] && mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
```

2. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarryCodes/nvim-config.git
```

3. **Move the cloned folder to your Neovim config directory and rename it:**

```bash
mv nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

> **Notes:**
> - The folder must be named `nvim` and located at `~/.config/nvim` for Neovim to recognize it.
> - If you cloned into a different directory, adjust the paths in the commands accordingly.
> - If you want to make changes to this configuration, please fork the repository first and clone your fork instead.

5. **Start Neovim:**

```bash
nvim
```

On first launch, [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) will automatically install all the configured plugins.

## Basic Setup

This configuration uses:
- Space as the leader key (`vim.g.mapleader = " "`)
- Line numbers enabled (`set number`)
- Smart indentation settings:
  - Tabs expanded to spaces (`set expandtab`)
  - Tab width of 2 spaces (`set tabstop=2`)
  - Soft tabstop of 2 spaces (`set softtabstop=2`)
  - Auto-indent of 2 spaces (`set shiftwidth=2`)

Each plugin's configuration is modularized in its own file for better organization and maintainability.

## Plugin Management

- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim): Modern plugin manager for Neovim that uses Lua and provides lazy-loading capabilities to improve startup time.

## Plugins

### User Interface

- [barbar.nvim](https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim): A tabline plugin that provides a clean interface for managing buffers with keyboard shortcuts for navigation (`<S-n>`, `<S-p>`), buffer selection (`<leader>1-9`), and closing buffers (`<leader>c`).

- [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim): A fast and customizable statusline plugin written in Lua that displays useful information about the current file, mode, git status, and more.

- [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim): A file explorer that provides a tree view of your project files and directories. Opens automatically on startup (when no file is specified) and can be toggled with `<C-n>`. Configured to show hidden and gitignored files.

- [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons): Adds file type icons to Neovim plugins such as Neo-tree and Barbar.

## LSP Servers

This configuration automatically installs and configures the following language servers:

- `lua_ls`: Lua
- `html`: HTML
- `cssls`, `cssmodules_ls`, `css_variables`: CSS
- `tailwindcss`: Tailwind CSS
- `ts_ls`: TypeScript
- `volar`: Vue
- `intelephense`: PHP (with Blade support)
- `rust_analyzer`: Rust
- `clangd`: C/C++
- `stimulus_ls`: Stimulus JS

## Performance Optimization

I've focused on optimizing performance in my configuration through several strategies:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Most plugins are configured to load only when needed using lazy.nvim's event system
   - Example: nvim-autopairs loads only on `InsertEnter`
   - Example: which-key loads on `VeryLazy` event

2. **Minimal Core**: The base configuration avoids unnecessary settings and keeps the core lightweight

3. **Modular Structure**: Each plugin is configured in its own file, making it easier to disable or modify specific components

## Troubleshooting

### Issues I've Encountered

#### Plugin Installation Failures

If plugins fail to install properly:

```bash
# Remove the plugin cache and reinstall
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy
nvim
```

#### LSP Server Issues

If an LSP server isn't working correctly:

1. Check if it's installed via `:Mason`
2. Reinstall the server if needed
3. Check the logs with `:LspInfo` and `:LspLog`

#### Treesitter Parser Problems

For syntax highlighting issues:

```
:TSInstallInfo    # See installed parsers
:TSInstall <lang> # Install a specific parser
:TSUpdate         # Update parsers
```

## Future Plans

Features I'm planning to add to my configuration:

- [ ] Add debugging support with nvim-dap
- [ ] Improve my git workflow integration
- [ ] Create custom keymaps for my project-specific tasks
- [ ] Add support for more LSP servers and languages that I work with
- [x] Implement session management for quick project resuming
- [ ] Create a custom dashboard for a nicer startup experience
