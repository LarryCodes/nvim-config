# nvim-config

This repository showcases the Neovim configuration I currently use for my day-to-day work—and, quite honestly, serves as a backup in case I need to start from scratch.
(Setting up Neovim is like trying to build a spaceship out of Lego pieces while blindfolded: the endless sea of plugins is equal parts thrilling and overwhelming. Arriving at a configuration that doesn’t make you want to toss your keyboard out the window? That’s a journey of trial, error, and a pinch of masochism.)
